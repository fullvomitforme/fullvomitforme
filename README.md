# Hello, I'm Tazkiya Mujahid! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a software enthusiast based in Jakarta, Indonesia. Currently, I work as a quality assurance professional at Ondelivery Indonesia. However, my true passion lies in full-stack development.

## Embracing the Full-Stack Journey

I'm on an exciting journey to become a skilled full-stack developer. From crafting captivating front-end experiences with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building powerful back-end solutions with Node.js, Express, and databases, I'm continuously expanding my skill set.

## Unleashing Creativity and Problem-Solving

Full-stack development allows me to unleash my creativity and tackle complex challenges. I love transforming ideas into reality, developing robust and user-friendly web applications, and making a positive impact through my work.
